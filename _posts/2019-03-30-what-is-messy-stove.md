## What is The Messy Stove?

The messy stove is a place that is home.  It’s a well-used space, one that sometimes is overlooked because the people are too busy eating to care. A messy stove is one on which you know things are happening.  Good things.  Like food.  Good food.  Sometimes not so great food, because, hey, we are humans and we mess up.

This is a place/space in which we are ok with our messy stoves (and by extension, kitchens, houses, gardens, and lives), because we are feeding ourselves and others, both relationally and physically.  I’ll write more later about this, but for now, let’s operate on the premise that people thrive in places and spaces that make them feel good and make them feel connected to others. We all want to feel connected to others; indeed, we are hard-wired to do so.  Alas, things get in the way of this. Let’s figure out how to manage those things and get more connected.

One way to do this is through food.  While you don’t need to cook that food to connect, there is a special kind of feeling you get when someone likes the food that you’ve made.  It’s a form of love.  

OK, right about now you might be thinking (because you are on this page), “But I can’t cook!” maybe feeling ashamed or upset that you can’t. Do not worry, because that’s what The Messy Stove is about.  I will show you how to cook.  Let’s go!
