Schnitzel

![schnitzel](/assets/images/doneschnitzel.jpg)

Oh, schnitzel, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.

Schnitzel is my favorite meal when I am in Germany or here in the States at a German restaurant. Think of it: pounded flat meat (more on this later), breaded, and fried.  Sublime.

But how to get it when I’m 1) not in Germany and 2) not at a German restaurant? Simple-make it myself.
Cook’s Illustrated has a great recipe (Sauteed Pork Cutlets) that I have used many times with success.  While you can go ahead and get the recipe, I thought I’d go through the steps with photos to illustrate the process.

So, the meat. Weiner (prounounce vee-ner) schnitzel means Vienna style schnitzel made with veal.  It is in my opinion the best.  However, I know that people have some feelings about veal, plus it’s expensive, so I make it with pork. Pork is also very tasty.  There is also chicken schnitzel; I’m not sure what I feel about that.  I am down with breaded and fried meat, but there is the tendency towards dryness if you use breast meat.

I use pork tenderloin: flavorful, often on sale (at least, where I live), and moist.

Pork tenderloin has a strip of tough material on one side, called the silverskin.  You will likely want to remove it, as it is rather chewy.

Slip a small sharp knife under one end to start the cutting. THen grasp the end you just cut and pull up, using the knife to help it along.

Cut tenderloin on the bias (angle) to widen the surface area (when you are flattening it, this gives you more space to flatten it).

Place wax paper on the cutting board, then put one medallion (cut piece of pork) on the paper, then cover with another piece of wax paper.

If you have a mallet like this

Then use it.  If not, you can use a cast iron fry pan or other really heavy pan.  The heavier the better.
Pound the meat, moving around the mallet/fry pan to make sure all parts of the medallion get the pound treatment. Try to make the cutlet (what it’s called once it’s flat) an even thickness.

When you are done, place on a plate and do it again.

When that is done, take three shallow pans and in one put some flour

In another put an egg or two, beaten

And in the last one, put breadcrumbs

Dredge the cutlets one at a time in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs.

Let the excess egg drip off.

The recipe recommends putting them on a wire cooling rack over a half sheet pan (jelly roll pan/cookie sheet with raised edges on all four sides) for about 5 minutes after coating to dry or something. I don’t know what that does, but you need a place to put the cutlets after you bread them so there you go.

In a deep wide pot (like a Dutch oven), put about half an inch to ¾ of an inch of canola oil. Do not use olive oil. Do not use peanut oil. Canola is purer and has a higher smoke point (it can be heated to a higher temperature than olive oil). It is also neutral tasting (peanut oil and olive oil have distinctive tastes. This is great when you want those tastes.  That time is not now).

Heat it over high flame. See my other post on how to tell when the oil is hot enough.

Carefully place one cutlet in pan then immediately (using potholders or gloves) shake the pan continuously (and carefully!) so that the oil goes over the top of the cutlet. This cooks the top and the bottom at the same time.  You will still need to flip it, but this means it won’t stay too long in the hot oil.

When should you flip it?  Take a look at it.  Is it golden brown when you use your tongs to lift up one side?  You can always flip it again.

![fry2](/assets/images/schnitzelfry2.jpg)

Once you flip it, it will likely take less time for this side to get done. Don’t forget to keep shaking the pan.

![fry3](/assets/images/schnitzelfry3.jpg)

Put the cutlet on the paper towel-lined plate and get ready to put in your next one.

Continue until all are cooked. Traditional garnish is a lemon wedge to squeeze over the yummy golden goodness. Eat hot.

Guten appetit!
