title: Goulash
---

OK, this isn’t really goulash like you get in Hungary or Germany or Poland.  This is just what my family called it.  

What is it?  Basically hamburger and pasta in a tomato sauce, “spiced up” with green pepper and onion.  That’s it.

Why is it good?  It’s cheap, it’s easy, and it’s satisfying, at least for me and my partner and child. I think a lot of who grew up in Midwest America in the late 60s/70s have some sort of dish like this that they love and have fond memories of.

What I said earlier is all that you need. 

Hamburger (around a pound)

Pasta (I prefer medium shells, but you can use what you like.  I would suggest a short pasta that’s thick: rigatoni, penne)

Green pepper-I freeze excess peppers from my garden and then use them in dishes like this that done require them to be crisp and firm. Maybe half of one, or maybe a third. It depends upon how much you like green pepper.  Oh, you can also use red; it just has a milder and sweeter taste, but what you notice is negligible. 

Onion-I like yellow onions but white or even red is fine (note: red onion leaches its color while cooking, so if you have a light or white dish, you may not want to use red onions.  Here it’s fine, due to the red tomato sauce)

Tomato sauce-Whatever brand you like is fine.  I use two small cans.

I have to admit that I have altered the family recipe a bit (sorry, mom!): I add garlic powder, as I think it adds a lovely depth of flavor.

How to make it

Start your water boiling. If you have a big pot, this is ideal, but it will also take more time to boil.  Some stove burners put out more heat than others, so the time will vary.  It will need to look like this before you put in your pasta.

Rolling boil

Brown your hamburger. If it’s frozen, you can either defrost in the microwave or just put it in the pan and scrape off the meat as it thaws/cooks. You will need to drain the water/grease off. I tilt the pan and use a large spoon to ladle it out into a coffee cup (because it’s heat resistant), pushing the meat up and letting the grease flow down.

You can add the diced (cut in small squares) peppers and onions at the same time as the hamburger, making this super easy.

Sprinkle on some garlic powder sometime during the cooking.  Also throw in some salt and pepper.  How much?  Enough. Just remember you can always add more, but you can’t take any away.  Start off with a teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, and between a half and a teaspoon of garlic powder (how much do you like garlic?).

OK, so once the hamburger mixture is browned and the veg are rather soft (poke them with a fork or knife), you can add the tomato sauce.

Is your pasta done?  Hopefully you followed the instructions on the box and set the timer for the fewest minutes (again, you can always cook it more, but if you overcook it, you’ve got overcooked pasta. Yuck.).

Drain your pasta in a colander, then add it to the hamburger mixture.  You might want to not add all of it; you can add more later.  Mix well with a large spoon.

Taste it; do you like the level of salt? Garlic? Pepper?  This is what is meant by “adjust seasonings” in recipes. It just means taste it to see if you like it.

OK, here it is. Nice quick comforting meal. If you want to be balanced, add a veg or something, but this is satisfying as is.
