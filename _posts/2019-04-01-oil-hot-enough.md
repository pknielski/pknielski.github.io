How do you know?  Two ways: when oil is hot, it will shimmer across the surface when you tilt the pan.

It gets hotter and more liquidy and looks almost wrinkly when you tilt the pan. The other way is to take a pinch of your flour and sprinkle it on the oil.  If it immediately sizzles, itâ€™s ready.
