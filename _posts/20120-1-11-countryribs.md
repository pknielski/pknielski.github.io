title: Country-style Braised Ribs
---

Have you ever seen something in the grocery labeled “country style ribs” and wondered what they are and what you can do with them? I did too, until I ran across a buy one get one free offer at my grocery and couldn’t pass up such a bargain.

But then I had three and a half pounds of these ribs that didn’t look like ribs.  What to do with them? Of course, I went to the internet to see what I could see.

Melissa D’Arabian?___ on the Food Network wrote this recipe and boy is it good.  I am recreating it here with step by step photos and directions, gleaned over my many times of making them.

What you need:
Country style bone in pork ribs
Carrots-1 or 2 (diced. Ok to not peel them)
Onion-1 medium (diced)
Celery-1 stalk (diced)
Tomato paste-1 tablespoon
Apple cider vinegar-2 tablespoons
Bay leaf-1
Chicken broth-enough to go up halfway up the side of the meat (I’ll talk more about his later, but just get a four cup box of chicken broth and you’ll be good)
Garlic-1 clove

OK, so these ribs are braised.  Braising is a wonderful technique; the oven does most of the work, and the result is tender, tasty meat. Braising basically means partially submerging the meat with liquid and then putting it in a slow (i.e., low temperature) over for a couple hours. 

For any braised recipe, you will want to build in some flavor before the actual braising.  What this means is that you brown the meat and sauté some aromatic vegetables (i.e., vegetables that get more flavorful when you slow sauté them, such as onions, carrots, and celery).

For this recipe (and any other braised recipe), you will want to make sure your meat is thoroughly thawed. If it isn’t, it might not brown well. You want this because it adds to the layers of flavor you are trying to develop. However, as the ribs will be in the oven a long time, you don’t need to worry about the meat being raw.

Pat the meat dry with a tea towel or paper towel. If the meat is damp, it will steam, lowering the temperature of the hot pan that you will be trying to brown the meat in. Your meat will not brown as much as it should to get that lovely brown color and tasty taste. Liberally (i.e., don’t hold back) sprinkle coarse salt (i.e., kosher salt) and pepper on the ribs, You can do one side, then put that side down in the pot; then you can salt and pepper the other sides.

What pan to use? I like a Dutch oven, which looks like this: *link* If you don’t have that, you would need a deep enough pan to contain the ribs and liquid. If you only have a stock pot, which is similar in diameter, but much taller, you can use that.  Just make sure it fits in the oven. Not great if you do all of this prep but can’t get your pot in the oven.  :D

In your Dutch oven (or whatever you are using, although you really should have a Dutch oven. I have feelings about this, obviously.), set the heat on high and coat the bottom of the pot with olive oil. Let it get shimmery (see this link for what it should look like). Once it is hot, place the ribs, seasoned-side down, in the pan.  Let them sit there getting brown. When are they done (i.e., browned)? When you can loosen them easily from the pan with tongs.  If they are hard to budge, they are not browned.  The browning process (i.e., Maillard reaction *link*) results in that loosening of the bond between the meat and the pan.  

Flip them to the next side (the ribs likely have four distinct sides that are wide enough to sit steady on the bottom of the pan). Season the side of the rib that is now on top.  Repeat until all four sides of each rib are brown.  Take them out and put them in a bowl (to contain the juices).

I hope you have diced your veg (i.e., cut them into small squares), because now you will put the onions, carrots, and celery into the pan that has the lovely brown bits on the bottom.  Make sure the heat is turned down first, as you want the veg to soften, not get brown (although if it gets brown, that’s ok). If you need a bit more oil, it’s ok to add, but there likely will be enough with both what you added at first and what came out as the fat rendered (became liquified with heat). Throw the minced garlic in after the veg get soft and stir around for a minute or less. 

Now you get that tablespoon of tomato paste and put it in the pot.  Stir it around while it cooks a bit. This will get rid of the raw tomato flavor that might be a bit sharp in your dish. The recipe says around three minutes, but use your judgment.  It will start to smell a bit different (but don’t burn it!). 

Add the quarter cup of apple cider vinegar and stir. You should see the brown bits on the bottom lift up; this is called deglazing the pan.

Put your ribs back in the pot and pour chicken stock in until the ribs are half-submerged. Throw in a bay leaf and put the lid on.

Stick it in your oven for about two hours (there isn't really any way to overcook this, unless you leave it in for 6 hours, which you won't). And there you have it-braised country-style ribs.  Aren’t you hungry? Serve with polenta (a recipe for another day) or egg noodles or mashed potatoes.
