Basil Gimlet

![glass](/assets/images/basilgimletglass_Fotor.jpg)

A gimlet is a lovely summer drink, especially if you infuse it with basil. Wait, you say-what is “infuse?” This means that the essence or flavor of the herb (basil here) is extracted (crushed or squeezed out) so that the oils or other flavor essences are now in the liquid (here the gimlet ingredients). 

Gimlets also make me think of the Roaring Twenties, The Great Gatsby, and flappers. Especially when I serve it in a coupe glass.

What goes into a gimlet?

Gin

Gin is a lovely liquor. Forget about your poor previous experiences with gin.  Forget that you don’t like gin. Gin combined with lots of lime and simple (sugar) syrup plus basil means that whatever you don’t like about gin you can’t taste. BUT! You can still taste the gin. Confused? I am positing that maybe what you don’t like about gin is its strong taste. Fair enough. There are ways to temper that-maybe by getting a better quality gin or perhaps by making a drink that uses ingredients that complement and temper those notes and flavors that are a bit more difficult to like.

ANYWAY

Gin (not super fancy gin-Bombay or Tanqueray is fine. Don’t use cheaper ones like McCormick)

Limes-how many?  Not sure.  Sometimes they can be sort of dry (i.e., with not a lot of juice in them). 4? 6? This is the best juicer I've found. It really does a good job and you don't have to put a lot of effort into it.

Basil-4-5 leaves? More if you are making more than one or two drinks.

Simple syrup

-sugar dissolved into water in a particular ratio. You can make it yourself or buy it. It's super easy to make, but if it's easier to buy it, do it. Here's one brand.

*bottle of simple syrup*

Make it yourself: It's a one to one ratio: one cup of sugar and one cup of water. Basically you are dissolving the sugar into the water and making sugar water. Heat the sugar and water combo to a boil. Boil gently until the water is clear (all sugar solids are dissolved). Make sure you let it cool to room temperature; it will also last in the fridge for a month or two.

All of these question marks are because it’s really a matter of taste.  Things to think about:

Simple syrup is sweet.

Lime juice is pretty sour.

Gin has a distinctive taste which you don’t want to lose.

Basil-we are going to put the basil on hold here, as I want you to get the basic gimlet first.

The key here is balance.  Have you ever gone to a place that does fancy cocktails and seen the bartender take a long spoon and taste the drink she is making?  If even professional bartenders do that, you can, too.  So what you do is mix some things (thoughtfully) and then taste.

A way to prepare yourself is to take a sip of each of your ingredients; this gives you knowledge that you can use as you make your drink.

Start with gin.  Put two ounces in a glass (if you want to be really fancy you can use a cocktail shaker, but you don't need to. Keep it simple). Squeeze two halves of a lime into the glass. Add a tablespoon of syrup.  Stir and taste with a spoon.  You want to be able to taste the lime and gin without your mouth puckering up. If you don’t like it, add something. Taste again.  See, the thing is that you need to like it.  A recipe is useless if you don’t like it.

Once it seems good, add ice.  Again, you can shake it with a cocktail shaker with the ice, or you can just stir it. If you do this, take out the ice after you stir it so it doesn't dilute the drink.  

You can stop right here and have a nice gimlet. However, if you have fresh basil, you can use it to make a lovely summer drink (or spring, or fall, or whenever).

Before you mix the liquids, put the basil leaves in the bottom of a glass (preferably the one you will drink out of) or a cocktail shaker, and then crush it.  The utensil to use, if you have one, is a muddler (squishing the flavor and oils out of something with a utensil is called muddling).

You can also use some other item or tool that can crush the leaves without tearing them all up. You want something with a wide end, not a fork or knife type of utensil. The end of the handle of a wooden spoon works well.

Crush the leaves until they are all bruised and dark.

Then add your gimlet ingredients and shake. Pour into your glasses.

You so fancy!
