Chicken Paprikash
This sounds fancy, but it’s really easy. In this recipe, I’ve cobbled together a couple different recipes. I often do this, as sometimes I don’t have an ingredient, for example, or I don’t want potatoes in my paprikash, but the recipe has some approaches I like.

What do you need:

Chicken thighs, bone in and skin on. Why? Because of the flavor of the skin and bones adds to the dish. If you don’t want to use bone in skin on thighs, feel free to use the boneless ones. Just don’t use chicken breasts; the flavor will be lacking. You could also use legs, if you like.

Paprika-I use a combo of sweet and smoked Hungarian paprika from Penzeys. If you don’t like the smokiness, just use sweet. Or you could just use smoky. It’s really up to you. I like the combo.

Onions-diced

Crushed tomatoes-canned works well. You can also use diced, but I would use petite dice, as the regular diced can be pretty chunky. However, if you like it that way, go for it! Make food the way you like!

Garlic-a couple three cloves, more or less, whatever you prefer.

Sour cream-this is what makes paprikash great. It tones down the bite of the paprika and makes a lovely creamy sauce.

Butter

Salt and pepper

Egg noodles-you can also use spaetzle or other types of pasta-ish things.

Equipment

Oven proof skillet-I like cast iron. You want it to have straight sides, not sloped, so the sauce doesn’t slosh out.

That’s it!

How to do it

Pat the chicken dry. I use paper towels.

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Sprinkle salt and pepper on the side that is facing up. You’ll get the other side when you flip it. 

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Put your skillet on the stove and put the flame on medium high. Let it get hot, then put in about a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of canola or olive oil. When it shimmers (see video here), carefully place your thighs skin side down in the pan. Don’t crowd them; that will lower the temperature and steam the skin rather than browning it.

Feel free to move the meat around and look underneath it. Sometimes you want to not move meat as you are looking for the Maillard reaction (see here). Here, however, the butter and chicken fat make for a hot fat frying situation (I just made that up).

When it looks like this

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Turn it over

The other side won’t look like this side when it’s done as there’s no (or little) fat/skin on it. No worries; just make it look brown-ish.

Take out the thighs when they are brown on both sides and put them on a plate. Finish browning the rest of them. 

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Now turn down the heat to medium low and add a lump of butter (maybe around a tablespoon). 

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Let it melt and then put in the onions. Stir frequently so they don’t burn. Toss in the diced carrots, too, around now. They will get soft in the oven, so don’t worry if they are still a little bit crunchy when the onions are done.

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Add the minced/crushed garlic and stir. Cook for only about a minute; you should smell the garlic more as it cooks (this is what cookbooks mean when they say, “cook until fragrant.”). 

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Add the paprika and stir. The idea is to bring out the flavor of the paprika by “cooking” it. Only do this for about 30-45 seconds as it will burn after that.

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Add the crushed tomatoes and some water (around half a cup. You can always add more or cook any excess liquid out). Bring it to a simmer (very light boil-you can see the liquid moving and bubbling a little, but the bubbles aren’t big). 

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Turn off the heat. Place the thighs skin side up on top of the sauce. Don’t get any sauce on the top; you want the skin to stay crispy.

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Put in the oven and bake for about 45 minutes. You will know it’s done when you poke it with a long fork and it’s super soft and falls off the bone.

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Take it out of the oven (carefully) and put on a heat-proof surface (your stovetop works). Take out the thighs and put them on a plate or platter with sides so any liquid doesn’t spill out. 

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Add about a half a cup of sour cream and whisk/stir briskly. Taste it-do you like the taste? You may need a pinch of salt or a sprinkling of pepper. If you aren’t sure, put a spoonful or so in a small bowl and add whatever to that, then taste. That way you don’t spoil the entire sauce by adding something that doesn’t work out. Once you know what your sauce needs, you can add it to the entire pan. But keep tasting!

![cco](/assets/images/CarrotCeleryOnion_Fotor.jpg)

Basically you are done at this point. You can put the thighs back in the pan, or you can keep them on the platter (this makes it easier to spoon out the sauce). But it does look pretty when the thighs are nestled there in that pretty sauce.

And there you have it-chicken paprikash.
