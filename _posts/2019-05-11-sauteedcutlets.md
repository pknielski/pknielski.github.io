title: Sauteed Chicken Cutlets
---
This is a great quick meal that I adapted from Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything. It’s basically his recipe, with more explicit instructions. Thanks, Mr. Bittman!

What you need

Chicken breasts-how many?  How many do you want to eat?
Flour
Salt
Pepper
Herbs-what kind?  I would suggest one or more of the following (all of these you can combine and they will be fine together): parsley, chervil, tarragon, chives, thyme. Smell and taste them to see what you like (tip-mix a bit with plain mashed potatoes or rice so you can better discern what they taste like in food).
Oil-olive or canola
Sautée or fry pan with sloping sides
Tongs
Shallow pan for dredging in flour
Cutting board
Knife

First
Take out the breasts and take a look at how thick they are and if they taper on one end.

The goal here is to make each cutlet (a thin piece of meat) approximately the same size.  Likely one side is thicker than the other. Cut the breast in half right around where it starts getting thinner.  Don’t worry about exactly where; you can cut it in half dead center and it will be fine.

Put your knife parallel to the cutting board and set it against the cut side of the breast. Place your non-dominant hand on top of the breast and slice the breast in half lengthwise. If your breast is partially frozen still, this step is easier.  However, you can still do it if it’s completely fresh or thawed.

Do this with all of your breasts.

Pour some flour in the shallow pan (I use this vintage banged up enameled pan I got at an auction decades ago. You can use a pie pan, a cake tin, or even a plate.  You just want something to put the flour in with a bit of protection from going outside onto your counter.). While you can season the flour, I find that I waste a great deal of herbs in getting the proportions right.  So I just season the cutlets themselves. How much flour?  Don’t worry about it.  If you don’t have enough, you can put more in.  It’s better to put too little in and then add more than to put in too much and waste it.

Sprinkle salt, pepper, and whatever herbs you chose onto the cutlets.  Turn them over and do the other side.

Dredge the cutlets in flour.

OK, I know you are thinking, WTF is dredging??  Simply stated, it’s coating the meat with flour, sometimes seasoned (salt, pepper, herbs), sometimes not (like now).  That’s it.

So, back to it. Dredge the cutlets in flour.  Put the chicken cutlets one at a time in the flour, making sure all surfaces are covered in flour.  That being said, you don’t want to pack a whole bunch of flour on them because that will be gross.  Make sure all are covered lightly; you will shake off excess flour right before you put them in the skillet.

Make sure your oil is hot enough.

How do you know?  Two ways: when oil is hot, it will shimmer across the surface when you tilt the pan.  It gets hotter and more liquidy and looks almost wrinkly when you tilt the pan. The other way is to take a pinch of your flour and sprinkle it on the oil.  If it immediately sizzles, it’s ready.

A note on burner settings: Every stove it different.  Every burner is different.  Rather than trying to determine what number or setting is “medium high,” pay attention to the height of the flame and, more importantly, the behavior of your food in the pan.  In this recipe, you want the heat to be high enough to make a brown coating on your meat, but not so much that it fries the outside and leaves the inside raw.  I get it that this is hard to do and may feel overwhelming, but just remember that you can always put the meat back in the pan/in the oven/on the grill.  Overcooking is the sin, not undercooking. 

When your oil is hot enough, pick up a cutlet with the tongs and gently lower it into the pan.  Gently because you don’t want the oil to splash out.  Continue with the others until they are all in the pan.  You should hear them sizzle. 

Let them cook there for some minutes. How many?  Well, it depends. I would say let them cook for 3-5 minutes, then use your tongs to pick up and edge and peer beneath. If it sticks, let it be; that means it’s still forming that brown coating.  If it isn’t brown, put it back down.

Once they are nice and brown (they won’t all be done at the same time so watch them), turn them over.  You may need a little more oil, but you may not.  You may need to lower the temperature a bit too as the pan will have had time to warm up. Repeat the checking process.

Note: another way to check for doneness is by pressing on the chicken and noting its feel.  Try doing this to a raw breast; it has a particular feel, kind of squishy.  As it cooks, it gets firmer.  Once it’s firm, it’s done.  However, you don’t want it too firm, because then it’s overcooked and dry, which is what we are trying to avoid.

Take out the chicken when you think it’s done. And that’s it! 

Note: If you are worried that it’s not done, cut into the middle and check.  You can always put it back in the pan; you can’t undo overcooking.

However…if you want to use that lovely brown stuff (called fond) in the bottom of the pan, pour a little white wine in the bottom while the heat’s on low.  You will see it sizzle and steam. Take a wooden spoon or silicon spatula and scrape the bits from the bottom of the pan; they should come up easily.  Now that you have deglazed the pan, you can add a bit of chicken broth to it.  Turn off the heat, add about a tablespoon of (real) butter and a squeeze of lemon.  Stir it in and once the butter melts, pour it over your chicken.  Hooray!  You’ve just made a pan sauce!
