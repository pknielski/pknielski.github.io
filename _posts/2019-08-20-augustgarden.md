title: August Garden

August in the Garden

I was thinking this week about how I garden, that I grow things that I donâ€™t necessarily eat. And then I realized that my dad did this.  This was especially true about watermelons.  He LOVED growing watermelons.  But he never (or maybe rarely) ate them.  He just liked the growing.  I feel Iâ€™m similar; I grow hot peppers that my family doesnâ€™t eat and that I rarely do. I plant various lettuces but rarely get to them before they bolt. Maybe Iâ€™m lazy, or maybe Iâ€™m a better grower of slow things. ðŸ˜Š I like the veg I grow, but I get more satisfaction from growing and harvesting than I do eating them.  For me, and perhaps other gardeners, it truly is the growing that is the focus and the source of my pleasure. I also love to give veg away.

So hereâ€™s my garden as of August __. Note the empty bed: my yellow squash developed powdery mildew while I was abroad so I had to rip it out.  Boo.

Green Zebra tomatoes: note the height. I got these tomato towers from Gardeners Supply Company (gardeners.com); they are awesome.  Not cheap, by any means, but they should last for some years.

Cucumbers are doing well. Itâ€™s a variety called something like market well or something. Straight (if trellised), dark skinned, and small seeded.

Cabbages, even eaten by cabbage moths/larvae, are doing well.  Looking forward to harvesting (and eating) those.

Basil is going to seed, which is fine. Lots of bees on the flowers.

Sage survived the polar vortex. It all seemingly died, but it came back in the spring. Another of those plants that I love to grow but rarely eat/use.

Dill-I have so much dill.  Most (all?) is volunteer.  I do use some, but mostly itâ€™s for swallowtail butterfly caterpillars.

Here are some of the flowers that are doing well.

I particularly like the ones in these containers. Iâ€™m not a super container garden planner, so I was surprised at how nicely these came together.

Other things are doing well.
