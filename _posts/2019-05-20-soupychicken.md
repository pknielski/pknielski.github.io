title: Soupy Chicken
---

This is an easy dish for those times you forget to thaw the chicken. I threw this together one night when I had planned to do something else with the thighs but forgot to thaw them. I liked it so much I cook it all the time.

Here’s what you will need to make it like I do.  However, you can change whatever you want-different vegetables, a different cut of chicken, different herbs. But try it once like this to get the hang of it and see how the flavors work together.

Chicken thighs

They can be frozen. I would use ones with skin and bones; they are cheaper, and the skin and bones adds flavor. For this recipe I think there were four in the frozen block.

White wine

Any dry (meaning not sweet) white would work.  Do not use Riesling (unless you got it in Germany, where they aren’t sweet), Moscato, Champagne/sparkling wine/prosecco, or fruit wine. Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc are good choices.  Chardonnay might be a bit too oaky or buttery for cooking.

Chicken broth 

I like unsalted so I can control the seasonings myself.

Carrots

How many?  How much do you like carrots?  Use that many.

Celery

One stalk should be fine. 

Onion

One small/medium one or half of one of those giant ones you see.  Can be white or yellow, but don’t use the sweet ones.  They are more expensive, and the sweetness will be wasted as the onions will be cooked.

Garlic

A clove or two, with the papery skin removed, should be fine. Dice or push it through a press.

Herbs

This time I used fresh parsely, thyme, and rosemary (left to right) because I happened to have them.  You can definitely use dried. How much?  Sprinkle them in and later when the meat is cooked, you can taste the broth and see what you think.  You can always add more.

Big pot with lid

Here’s mine.  It’s called a Dutch oven. It is truly one of the most versatile pots I own.  I use it for all sorts of dishes: braised meat, popcorn, stews, risotto. Yes, those Le Creuset Dutch ovens are beautiful, but you can’t sear/brown meat in them.  Ask me how I know this.  Not a Le Creuset; thankfully, one much cheaper, but the nice finish is brown and damaged. I still use it, though.

Tongs

Best kitchen implement ever.  I have three and could use more.

How to make it

Put your chicken in the pot and pour a box of chicken broth over it.  Add a cup or so of wine. Put the heat on high while you cut up the vegetables. Note: make sure there is liquid in the pot before you turn on the heat. Otherwise, you will get spatter and evaporation if you add it after the pot is hot.

Cut up the vegetables

Carrots

They can be any size you want them to be.  Dice them, leave them in chunks, whatever.  You will want to peel them with a vegetable peeler, as the skins will slide off once the carrot is done, which is a little gross, I think, in the dish. Yes, there are vitamins in there.  There are also vitamins in the rest of the carrot.  Do what you like.

Onions

I would recommend dicing them so you aren’t eating big chunks of onion.

Celery

I cut them lengthwise and then dice them as I like smaller chunks.

Once the veg is cut, add them to the pot.  

Herbs

If using fresh, you will want to chop them into fine pieces.  Except for the thyme: you can pull off the little leaves by holding the stalk in one hand and pulling the fingers of the opposite hand down the stalk in the opposite direction of growth.  Basically, you are stripping the leaves from the stalk. If this doesn’t make sense, don’t worry. Take the leaves off however it works for you.

Parsley

Rosemary

Thyme

Add the herbs. Whoops, I forgot I added a bay leaf.  That's that oval shaped leaf on top.  They are usually only found dried here in Chicagoland. You can add it or not.

Also add salt and pepper.  How much?  Let’s say a teaspoon and a half of salt and a teaspoon of pepper.  It really depends on how much chicken and broth you are using. Go easy at first; you can always add more.

When the pot is boiling, lower the heat to a simmer (basically you still want movement of the liquid, but not a lot). When everything is in, put the lid on.  Listen/watch for boiling; the lid will hold in more heat, with the result being the liquid being less of a simmer and more of a boil.

Let it simmer until it’s done.  How will you know?  Check the carrots by poking a fork or knife into one.  If it goes in easily, it’s done.  Check the chicken by using the tongs to remove a chunk of meat.  If it comes off easily and isn’t pink or semi-translucent (see-through), it’s done.

What I like to do is take the meat out and put it in a large bowl.  I then use two tongs to take off the skin and then remove all the meat from the bones.  Then I return the meat to the pot.  You can also use two forks; just remember it will be hot and the tongs give you greater distance from the heat. 

Discards 

This should also include the bay leaf; it is inedible.

Taste the broth and adjust seasonings. Basically, that just means you see if there’s enough salt, pepper, and herbs to your liking.  If you don’t know how much of something to add, take a bit of broth out and put it in a mug or coffee cup.  Add your seasonings to that and taste.  That way, if you add too much, you won’t have ruined the entire dish.  Remember, you can put more in, but you can’t take any out.

To accompany the soupy chicken, you can make rice or noodles.  I chose rice this time.

That’s it!  You’re done!  Good job!
