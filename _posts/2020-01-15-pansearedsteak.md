Pan-Seared Steak

My son, when I asked him what I should write about for my next blog post, suggested steak.  Guess what we had that next night?

This is a good technique for when it's too cold to grill outside or you don't actually have a grill.

What you need:

Steak

What kind? Well, it’s really up to you, but here’s a primer about my favorite choices.

Kansas City/New York strip-are these different? Maybe? In my supermarket, it’s sometimes called New York strip steak, sometimes just strip steak. This is a longish medium marbled (fat lines throughout the meat that adds to its tastiness) cut.

Rib-eye: My favorite for flavor (very marbled) but fatty and not to everyone’s taste.

Filet: very lean (low marbling) so you have to make sure not to overcook it as it will be tough and dry.

There are other cuts, but these seem to be what’s common in the grocery, at least where I live.

Pay attention to the thickness of the steak. I've been seeing lately "thin cut" steaks; not sure why. The thinner the steak, the quicker it will cook, making it easy to overcook.  

So this one is labeled on the package as a New York strip steak.

I have seen it recommended to let the meat come to room temperature before cooking.  It probably matters on some level, but if you don’t have time, don’t worry about it.

Pat it dry with paper towels or tea towel.

Sprinkle liberally (generously) with coarse (kosher) salt and pepper. Some people like steak seasoning or Lawry’s. Those are fine, too.
You will need a pan that will stand up to high heat.  The best for this, in my opinion, is cast iron.  Everyone should have a cast iron pan.

Turn on your oven hood fan and put the pan on the stove with high heat. Sprinkle coarse salt on the pan. 
When it’s hot (hold your hand over it or toss a drop of water on it to see if it immediately evaporates), put your steak in it. It will sizzle in a very yummy way.

Use tongs to both feel the density of the steak (more on this later) and to lift the edge of the steak to check the browning.

When it's brown enough, flip it over.  Feel free to cut into the  steak to check its doneness; it's no sin. You want it the way you want it, right?

When it's done, take it out, and set it on a plate or cutting board.  Tent loosely with foil (this means make a tent-like cover for the steak. Don't tuck it in or fold it around the steak; you want air to circulate) and let rest for about 5-10 minutes,  The foil will also keep the heat in.

And...you're done!

So, checking the density/degree of doneness by touch.  This will come with practice, but there’s no reason you shouldn’t try now.  Raw meat is kind of bouncy when you press on it.  It becomes less so as it cooks. In fact, it gets firm, and when it’s well done, it is very firm.  If you don’t like it well done, then you should learn how to tell doneness before it gets to that point.

I’ve heard some folks talk about similarities to different body parts (e.g., tip of nose, ball of palm) but I never remember that (obviously). So I press tongs against the meat.  It’s not perfect; the night I took these photos they were too raw.  That’s ok, though, as you can just throw it back in the pan, which is what I did.  

My son said it was delicious, so there’s that.
