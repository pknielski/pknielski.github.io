title: Pan-fried Tilapia
---

Tilapia is such a tasty fish!  And it’s readily available.  Trader Joe’s usually has it frozen in two-filet blocks.  The Jewel recently began carrying individually packaged frozen tilapia filets, which is great because you can just pull out the number that you want and put the rest back in the freezer.

Thaw the frozen filets unopened (if they are packaged) or in their original package in water.  You can also run cold water over them if you are in a hurry.  However, they thaw very quickly, which makes them great for a school/work night.

When they aren’t frozen anymore (thawed), take them out of the container you thawed them in and pat them mostly dry with a paper towel. 

Put some bread crumbs (unflavored, unless you like the flavoring.  Even so, it’s better to use your own fresh or dried herbs) in a shallow pan.  Determine what herb or herbs you want.  If you have no idea what goes with each other or with your food, try a mixture.  I like Fox Point Seasoning from Penzey’s. You can add this to the breadcrumbs and mix it in if you like.  I find that I don’t get enough of the herbs on the fish and much of it gets thrown away or put into the compost bin.  Or you can season the filets directly.

Put a large sauté/fry pan on your burner and turn the flame to medium high.  Once it’s hot (hold your hand over it, but don’t touch.  Der.), add olive oil and heat until it is hot.  If you don’t know when that is, I have a short post on this here: 

Meanwhile, take your filet and dredge it in the breadcrumbs (dredge means put it in the breadcrumbs, first one side, then the other, until the fish is coated).  It should stick to the slightly damp fish. Shake off any excess gently, then place in the heated pan.

It should sizzle.  Now right now you may be panicking: how will I know when it’s done?  A couple things: first, you will see the edges start to turn brown, particularly the thinner edges.  You can also stick a long-tined fork in the fish and see what it feels like.  Try poking both the thinner edge and the thicker part.  You should feel no resistance to the fork once the edges start browning, and there should be a bit of resistance in the thicker part.  Don’t wait until the thicker part is done to flip the fish; you will likely burn it and/or over cook it.

If you have a fish spatula, great!  This spatula is very thin and flexible, so you can get under the fish easily.  If not, no worries.  Use a regular spatula.

Carefully turn over the fish.  I find it helpful to use two spatulas, one under and one on top, to control the turn.  

If your fish is sticking, you may want to add a bit more oil after you turn it, but only a bit.

Check the thick parts, and when there is little to no resistance, turn off the heat and put them on your plate! Voila! Easy tasty tilapia!
