# How to…choose the right chicken part

A chicken (actually any fowl) can be divided into four types of edible parts (there are inedible parts but we don’t need to talk about them right now) and categorized into two types of meat: white and dark. Dark meat (leg and thigh) has richer, tastier meat.  Breast meat can be dry; you probably already know this.

### White meat

Breast – Often cut into halves. The halves are what we think of as chicken breasts, but they are actually half of a whole breast.

Wings- Wings have three parts, but we only eat two of them. The wing tip (flat pointy part) doesn’t really have meat on it. 

### Dark meat

Legs- Never boneless. Well, I have never seen boned legs.  I concede that this may occur somewhere.

Thighs- Can be bought with bone and skin or skinless and boneless.


### To bone or not to bone

Chicken (or most, if not all, meat) that’s been cooked with the bone in is tastier and juicier.  However, it can be kind of a pain to eat, and sometimes having the bone or bones in can alter the cooking timing.

However, the main decision-making factor has to do with the dish and its cooking method.  For instance, for the grill, I like boneless skinless chicken thighs.  They don’t dry out, and they cook quickly. Alternately, for a braise, in which the meat is seared on the stovetop to brown and then half-submerged in liquid in the over for several hours, I use bone-in and skin-on thighs.  The bones and skin have flavor that come out during the long cooking. I then discard the skin and take the meat off the bones (See Braised Chicken Thighs).  I use breasts for stir fries, sautéed cutlets (see Sauteed Chicken Cutlets), and risottos.

### To skin or not to skin

Similar to the reasons for using bone-in chicken, using skin-on chicken adds to the flavor of the dish.  For instance, when braising, you would want skin-on because the browning of the chicken makes the fond, the brown stuff on the bottom of the pan that has lots of flavor.  You would not want skin-on if you are stir frying the chicken or poaching it (simmering it in liquid).

### Legs and Wings



I don't use legs (AKA drumsticks) or wings very often.  They simply aren't as versatile as breasts and thighs.  However, don't let that stop you if you like these parts. Fried chicken legs are awesome.  And buffalo wings rock. So if you want to use them, do it.
