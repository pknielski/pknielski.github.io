Pallet planter

I have had this pallet for over a year, just leaning up against my garage wall.  The soil for my newest raised bed came in a big bag sitting on top of the pallet.  I had heard of using for plants but didn’t get around to it until this spring.  

Basically, it’s some S hooks, these things (don’t know what they are called, but they are used on hoses to tighten connections)(need pics)), and terracotta pots.

Since this was in a semi-shady spot, I made sure to choose herbs that could handle that type of sun level. German thyme, Greek oregano, flat parsley, two curly parsleys (I think one was in the wrong place and I didn’t pay too much attention), and French thyme. These were all labeled semi-shade; we’ll see how it goes. If your spot gets more sun, you will want to have herbs that do better in the sun. Basil and rosemary, for instance, need full sun.

I randomly hung the hoops (that’s what I’m going to call them) on the S-hooks wherever I thought they looked good.  You should hang yours where you think they look good; some people like more symmetrical, which could be really nice. 

I used these terracotta pots that are pretty inexpensive. It’s important to put some rocks or pot pieces in the bottom so the roots won’t sit in any water that accumulates in the bottom of the pot.  This will rot the roots and kill/weaken your plant. I use broken pot pieces; I have a lot. Don’t ask.

Put a bit of soil in the bottom of the pot, not too much as you don’t want the plant to be too high when you put it in.  You are going to put the entire plant in the pot, soil and all. So I’d say about an inch or two loosely in the bottom.  Important: use container soil, not garden soil, top soil, or soil you get from your yard.  Those will all be too dense and won’t drain well.  While you want the water to stay in the pot long enough for the roots to take up (drink) the water, you don’t want the soil to stay sopping wet.  Your roots will rot and your plant will die.  Use container soil instead; this has ingredients that don’t absorb water and make the soil loose/non-compacted.

Using your dominant hand, support the plant around the stalk where it meets the soil (need pic). Turn the pot upside down while you support the plant.  Some soil may fall out; that’s ok.  Hold it over the new pot to save it if you like.

The plant should fall out into your palm.  If not, you may need to gently shake the pot or squeeze it if it is stuck.

Then place the plant in the middle of the pot and put some new soil around the edges and on top.  Poke your finger down the edges to make sure the soil goes down to the bottom.  You may need to put some more soil on.  Pack it firmly, but not super tight.  Remember, you are not wanting it to be so densely packed that water can’t drain out easily.  

Leave about an inch between the soil and the top of the pot.  Keep in mind that, once you water, the soil may compress. You can add more soil if you like.

Do this for all of the plants.  Then water them thoroughly.  What does that mean?  It means pour water on, let it sink in, then pour some more.  The pot will get heavier. If the water starts draining out the drain hole on the bottom, stop. You’re done.

Place the pots in the hoops.  Move them around.  Admire your work. Look what you just did!
