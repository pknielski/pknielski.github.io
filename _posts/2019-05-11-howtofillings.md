title: How to...use leftovers for taco filling
---

So last night (or a couple days ago) you made a roast/a steak/some chicken/a pork tenderloin.  You don’t want to eat it again (maybe you’ve eaten it already as leftovers) but you certainly don’t want to throw it away (food waste is a serious concern). So what do you do?

One thing I do is make a filling for tacos. It’s super easy. All you do is cut up the meat into small pieces, combine with diced onions, and add seasoning.

Here is some pork tenderloin I sauteed last night.  I diced it (cut it into small cubes) and added onions and later added  Arizona Dreaming by Penzey’s Spices.

Here is the seasoning blend I use- Arizona Dreaming by Penzey's. If you don't know them, you should check them out.  Awesome spices and strong values. www.penzeys.com

Here is the pork in the pan with the onions and seasonings. This is what it looks like around the time you first put it all in the pan.

Cook it over medium low heat. Turn it down if your onions start to get dark brown; you want to cook the onions slow enough that they turn translucent. Then you can crisp them up a bit. 

This pork is not done (well, not like I like it; it is certainly done, as you cooked it yesterday, or the day before, or whatever). If you compare it closely with the next photo, you may see that the onions in the next photo are browner, as is the chicken.

This is how I like my filling-crispy-ish onions, browned meat. This is the chicken breast.

That’s it! Now you can put them in a tortilla with some nice additions, like sour cream, greens, cucumbers, salsa, and any other leftover veg. Or throw some tortilla chips in a bowl and add the above ingredients for a taco salad. 

Another idea: You can make a quesadilla by putting a flour tortilla in a pan, adding shredded cheese and some of the meat, and putting another tortilla on top.  If that’s too big, you can put the ingredients on one side and fold over the tortilla.  Use a medium-medium low heat; you want the cheese inside to melt before the tortilla browns.
