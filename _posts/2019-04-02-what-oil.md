title: How to...know what kind of oil to cook with?
---
Olive oil-great for cooking, but it has a lower smoke point than other oils.  This means that it smokes at a lower temperature, meaning it could burn your food and/or change the taste of your food. So you wouldn’t deep fry in it. Get extra virgin, not light/lite. Please don't call it EVOO.

Canola oil-Great all around oil, little to no taste (olive oil has a distinct taste, but how distinct depends upon quality, location the olives are produced, and other factors). Higher smoke point than olive oil.

Peanut oil-great for frying.  Be careful if anyone’s allergic to peanuts, though.

Vegetable oil-fine for cooking, similar to canola, but higher in saturated fat than canola. Often cheaper, so if that’s what your budget demands, go ahead and use it.

Corn oil-can impart a bit of roasted corn flavor, but this is only for certain foods/usage.  Higher saturated fat than canola.

My opinion: Have both extra virgin olive oil and canola oil in your pantry. You shouldn’t need anything else at this stage of your cooking life.
