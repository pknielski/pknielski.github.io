Fruity salsa

I knew I had coming in my Imperfect box jalapenos, mango, green onion, heirloom grape tomatoes, and cilantro (I did a little planning, but didn’t know exactly what I would be doing with all of this).

At the Jewel, I saw some frozen ahi tuna steaks, and I thought, “Ahi with mango salsa!” Don’t be fooled; I rarely think so coherently about meal planning. It was really the planets or something aligning.

OK, so. Salsa means sauce in Spanish, but it seems to have a more narrow definition here in the States (please correct me if I am wrong, peeps). I think of salsa as being that tomatoey jalapeno stuff we eat with tortilla chips (which is so awesome, don’t get me wrong). However, I think that folks outside of the States have a broader understanding of what salsa is and/or could be.

Certainly one common salsa version I see is mango salsa-often mango, jalapeno, maybe tomato, and certainly onion. I often see this paired with fish tacos. 

So, I was thinking, mango salsa with ahi tuna. I have eaten this and cooked this before.  But I also had a nectarine from my Imperfect box.  What if I include that?

This is what I did:

Peel and cut up mango

FYI: mangos have a big pit so you have to cut around it.  I am sure there are tutorials about how best to cut up a mango.  That’s not what’s happening here.

Add to bowl.

Peel and cut up nectarine

I think this is a white fleshed nectarine. Similar taste, but it seems to cost more in the supermarket.  Do a taste test to see if it’s worth that extra cost.

Cut up green onions

I like green onions for a lot of dishes; they are distinct in taste, but also mild.

Cut up the tomatoes. These were from my Imperfect box; kind of a pain to cut up, as they are small, but really no more of a pain than larger sized ones. Not sure why I’m complaining. 

Cut up jalapeno (my other half can’t do too much capsaicin, so I didn’t add as much as I would have for myself or others. Feel free to add as much as you like). Tip: fresh jalapenos vary tremendously in their heat profiles; nibble on a little bit of the pepper to see how spicy yours are. 

Note: you don’t have to include jalapenos. In fact, you don’t have to include anything you don’t want to.  Don’t like mango? Try peaches. Or nectarines. Or just omit the fruit. The beauty of this is that you can include whatever you want.

I also included some cucumber from my garden, because they are starting to take over. Again, you should add only what you like.  Or, if you don’t know what everything might taste like together, you could combine a few ingredients, let them sit for a bit, and then taste them.

Now I added salt, pepper, and some Penzey’s Arizona Dreaming mix. 

*Arizona dreaming*

A short aside:

I know I’ve talked about Penzey’s before, but let me just say that not only do they have super high quality spices, Bill Penzey also lives his values. He stands up for what he believes in, and he doesn’t change them to make more money. You may not agree with him (but I hope you do, because he is in favor of human rights, reproductive justice, and uniting people through cooking. Bill is awesome.), but I hope you support a person and a business living their values authentically and honestly.
