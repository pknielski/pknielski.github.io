To me, home and connection revolves around the kitchen, more specifically, the stove.  It is where almost all food begins, spends time in, or ends up.  It also represents the hearth, that center of the home, the place that Frank Lloyd Wright said “is the psychological center of the home.” He was right/Wright (hah); without the hearth, the house is not a home.  It is cold, disconnected, starved.  With it, you have a centered, relational space around which a family or community can gather and be nourished.
