To me, home and connection revolves around the kitchen, more specifically, the stove.  It is where almost all food begins, spends time in, or ends up.  It also represents the hearth, that center of the home, the place that Frank Lloyd Wright said is "the psychological center of the home.‚Äù He was right; without the hearth, the house is not a home.  It is cold, disconnected, starved.  With it, you have a centered, relational space around which a group of people can gather and be nourished. 

But what if you can't cook?  How do you create and nurture this space?  Cooking may seem to be an impossible feat. If this is you, you are in the right place. I will show you how to cook, step by step, never assuming that you know something.
